## School Internship Resume
A little resume for a school computer internship.

### What's going on?
I'm applying for an internship. While writing my resume, I watched the bland text drag across the even blander paper in an attempt to convice those who read this resume of my ability to, quite stereotypically, "get the job done." I grew bored, so I decided to make this thing to give to the interviewers instead.

### Getting the code
In your terminal, run the following
```
git clone https://github.com/synergistics/schoolInternshipResume
cd schoolInternshipResume
npm install
```

### Running this thing
After "Getting the code", run the following in your terminal
```
npm start
```
Now just navigate your way over to your favorite browser (this probably doesn't work well in IE) and go to `localhost:3000`.
