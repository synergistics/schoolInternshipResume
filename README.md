## School Internship Resume
A little resume for a school computer internship.

### What's going on?
I am (was) applying for a computer internship. While writing my resume, I grew terribly bored. I felt like the document I was producing was too standard, too black ink on white paper. "They're gonna see a dozen more of these -> why am I doing this -> seriously, why? -> how do I write modern web apps with innovative, rapidly evolving technologies -> I'm hungry." The text I typed ached to be more than typed! So... I made this to give to the interviewers instead.

### Getting the code
Run the following in your terminal.
Make sure you have NPM and node.js installed on your machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/synergistics/schoolInternshipResume
cd schoolInternshipResume
npm install
```

### Running this thing
After "Getting the code", run the following in your terminal
```
npm start
```
Now just navigate your way over to your favorite browser (this probably doesn't work well in IE) and go to `localhost:3000`.

### If you don't feel like installing extra software
You should be able to just clone the repo (using that first command I gave you above).
Unzip the repo and navigate to the app folder in your file explorer. Then just double click the index.html file to get going!
