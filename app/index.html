        Hello! I'll break my skills down into a few categories
        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <ul> 
          <li>Javascript (2 years)</li>
          <li>Python (1 year)</li>
          <li>Various other lesser known languages such as Scheme and Haskell</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Social Interation</h3>
        <ul> 
          <li>I attended an open source software conference called FOSSCon and had the opportunity to network with people in various IT fields.</li>
          <li>Frequent many IRC channels where I can gain and redistribute knowledge to and from others. I'm often on the Haskell chat.</li>
          <li>I taught a young friend of mine interested in programming some fundamentals for around two months.</li>
          <li>Working in teams is always a pleasure of mine.</li>
          <li>Participated in the SMECO Computer Bowl</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>General Computing</h3>
        <ul> 
          <li>I've been running Linux machines (Ubuntu and Arch flavors) for about two years now.</li>
          <li>I have a basic understanding of most common computer hardware and networking.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="ambition">
        <em>Computers are my passion and have been for quite a while!</em>
        <p>Haha, I've been building software since I was 13. It's constantly been
        my goal to improve, to become the best at what I do, and to help other people doing the same.
        Computers have led to the creation of wonderfully interesting fields (computer science, cybersecurity, etc.)
        and will continue to do so in the future. That realization is part of what got me started.</p>
        <p>I've got a few plans for the future. Becoming a CEO of a large tech company is the goal that comes to mind immediately. 
        Solving problems in the world and testing the limits of what I and others can create are things I'm looking forward to tremendously.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="why">
        <em>Why? That's a pretty ambiguous question on its own.</em>
        <p>Hmm. Why. Well I suppose why I <em>want</em> to be involved in this internship is a good start. From what I've heard
        (I talked to Ms. Alleyne), this seems to be a great opportunity for me to expand my knowledge and abilities regarding computers, but
        also regarding people. It's likely all of the accepted candidates will know each other, but working as a team on problems where the answers 
        aren't immediate is something I can say we've lacked experience in. Gaining that experience would be invaluable to me.</p>
        <p>And why should you accept me? Aside from having a bit of experience in IT, I feel that my enthusiasm around computers is indicative
        of my belonging. A person who's willing to learn is a person who learns more. I look forward to learning more about Linux, networking, and
        computer hardware in this program. I'm looking to learn and help, so I hope you'd be willing to teach me.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="academia">
        <em>Couldn't think of anything clever to say</em>
        <p>What's notable in my academic career (and it's hard for me to even say that), is that I've maintained 4.0 GPA or higher through out 
        high school (currently 4.5).</p>
        <h3>And my computer related classes?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Design Tech Solutions (I believe the name has changed now)</li>
          <li>Computer Science Principles</li>
          <li>AP Computer Science A</li>
          <li>MATLAB Principles</li>
        </ul>
